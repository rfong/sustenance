makes 12x 6" naan. fluffy yet crisp! adapted from [recipe tin eats](https://www.recipetineats.com/naan-recipe/)

wet ingredients
- 2 tsp instant yeast
- 1 cup warm water (105F/40C)
- 1 egg, whisked
- 4 Tbsp (1/4 cup) ghee or butter, melted

dry ingredients
- 1 tsp salt
- 3.5 cups bread flour

toppings
- melted ghee/butter with 4 cloves garlic, crushed/microplaned
- nigella seeds
- minced cilantro leaves

Methodology
- Mix the yeast into the warm water and let bloom for 10 minutes or until bubbly.
- Separately so as not to kill the yeast, melt the butter.
- Whisk egg and combine all wet ingredients.
- Sift together the dry ingredients.
- Mix together wet & dry into a ball of dough. Cover and let rise until doubled in size, 1-2 hours depending on temperature.
- Lightly flour a surface, cut the dough into 12 pieces, and shape them into balls. Let rise 15 min or until increased 50% in size. The consistency should be loose enough to easily shape into thin rounds about 1/8" thick.
- Shape into 6-7" rounds.
- Heat a cast iron skillet on high with a bit of oil/grease with a high smoke point, such as avocado oil or ghee.
- Briefly cook naan ~1 minute each side until golden brown. Brush/sprinkle with toppings. Serve hot!
