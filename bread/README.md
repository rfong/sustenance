# bread

Hello! I am a non-professional home baker who has fed thousands of kilos of low-effort crowd-pleaser bread to hundreds of people since 2008, with a wide variety of constraints on time and kitchen/fridge space. Here are my elaborately spreadsheet-optimized (yet mostly deceptively simple) bread tips!

See also my blog post, [The Five Stages Of Bread Effort](https://rhetoricize.medium.com/the-five-stages-of-bread-effort-1190cd8b2d97).

## use cases
- Want to easily produce a very large volume of inexpensive & crowd-pleasing calories for a potluck/picnic? Make [high-hydration ciabatta](sourdough_ciabatta.md) (18 hrs lead time), [seedy bread](seedy_bread.md) (18 hrs lead time), or [pain l'ancienne](pain_lancienne.md) (2-3 days lead time).
- Want to punish yourself while simultaneously deepening your understanding of bread chemistry and perfecting your mastery over bread variables? Try [Tartine-style sourdough](sourdough_tartine.md).
- Want to do an interactive bread activity with friends? Try [simple flatbread mountain](flatbread.md) (quick & super easy), [soft pretzels](soft_pretzels.md) (medium speed & ease), or [sourdough bagels](ny_sourdough_bagels.md) (prep required).
- "I don't have time to make bread": I made pain l'ancienne 2-3 times a week while working 90 hrs/week as an MIT undergrad with a $100-120/mo food budget, so I'm pretty confident that anyone with an oven and a fridge can fit this bread into their lifestyle. It really is that low-effort. And it's nice for a student budget that you can get bread flour from restaurant supply stores for $0.40/lb!

## effort notes on my favorite breads, sorted from least to most labor-intensive
+ [flatbread mountain](flatbread.md) - Quick and simple flatbread mountain party pile with no lead time. Requires a powerful range hood and good ventilation. I have definitely set off the smoke alarm many times; try to use a high-smoke-point oil such as avocado oil or ghee. Best with 1-2 helpers. [Naan](naan.md) is more delicious and also very simple to make, but dough needs to be prepped 1-2 hours ahead of time and will get your hands oily.
+ [pain l'ancienne](pain_lancienne.md) - Delayed fermentation bread, or pain l'ancienne. Instant yeast based. Extremely low-effort bread, no dough babysitting time. Very bready tasting, not sour. 15 min active work (5 min mixing, 2-3 days waiting, 10 min shaping on bake day). Requires dough fridge space for 2-3 days. Crowd pleaser.
+ [high-hydration ciabatta](sourdough_ciabatta.md) - I call my variant "Fool's Ciabatta". A super-high-hydration quick ferment using both sourdough starter and instant yeast. Extremely moist and holey with fantastic rise and a mild yet rich flavor, almost eggy-tasting somehow. Soft but browned crust. Only a little more work than pain l'ancienne. 5 min active work, 1-3 hrs of occasional babysitting, then 10 min of baking work. Crowd pleaser. Can be done either same day or overnight.
+ [seedy bread](seedy_bread.md) - Hearty moist seedy bread with some whole wheat and rye flour! Crowd pleaser. Similar amount of work to ciabatta, longer primary fermentation. Uses a dutch oven.
+ [scallion pancakes](scallion_pancakes.md) - There are many ways to make scallion pancakes, but Hannah Che's version is the most delicious by far. Dough requires an overnight fridge rest, and then it's just a lot of very oily rolling and shaping that is better done with the help of friends and aprons.
+ [sourdough bagels](ny_sourdough_bagels.md) - Adaptation of Peter Reinhart's NY-style sourdough bagels to work with less fridge space. Better done with friends.
+ [tartine sourdough](sourdough_tartine.md) - Tartine-style sourdough. Not too sour, tender and holey crumb but not too holey, crunchy crust, very beautiful when done correctly. Tasty but effortful; requires a solid day of babysitting (about 8 hrs on/off) and then the next morning (~1.5 hrs).

## my tools
*necessary*

+ bread knife
+ 500F-capable oven
+ baking sheets
+ big mixing bowl or dough tub. when making sourdough, I like using a clear 8-quart tub from the restaurant supply store, which makes it really easy to see how much my dough has risen. I keep a dry erase marker around to mark dough rise and write down times on the tub.
+ bench scraper if handling wetter doughs over 70% hydration

*necessary if you want to Follow A Recipe or quantify your recipe for others, but lots of home bakers just wing it by feel*

+ kitchen scale with tare function
+ measuring spoons
+ probe thermometer

Tip: 100-110F is usually the only really important water temperature you need to hit for bread baking purposes, to bloom your yeast or feed your starter. I don't use a thermometer for this. To hit this target temperature, I'll combine about 40% boiling water + 60% tap-cold water, i.e. `(212*0.4) + (50*0.6) ~= 115`, and assume I've lost 5-10F by transference into a room temperature container. (Transference loss varies by the amount of water you're using.) I also always double check by dunking my hand in the water. If it feels hot like a hot tub but I can leave my hand in the water without any pain, then it's in the 100-110F range.

*convenient splurges, but not required*

+ ambient thermometer - doesn't need to be too accurate; I have a cheapo $5 thermometer I put on top of my dough proofing tub to help me know about how fast it might rise.
+ reusable bowl wrap (I have a Bee's Wrap, which isn't remotely airtight, so I tie it down with a piece of bungee cord)
+ parchment paper or 500F-resistant silicone sheet liner. can also use cornmeal/semolina, or grease although that has a higher chance of burning the bottom. Silpats are excellent. I finally splurged on a Silpat after 15+ years of breadmaking and am now kicking myself because it would totally have paid off for me in parchment paper savings after 1-2 years.
+ Dutch oven (or can use a combo cooker or any other upside-down oven-safe pot to trap steam. you can also simply put a steam pan full of water in the oven, though the bread doesn't come out quite as well that way)
+ shaped proofing vessel (bannetons are popular for a fancy look, although personally I still use a regular mixing bowl lined with a floursack towel)
+ cooling rack (not necessary but convenient. I did fine without one for the first decade of baking and finally got myself one as a little treat)
+ [proofing box!!!](https://breadtopia.com/store/breadtopia-proofing-box/) Professional proofing boxes are large and expensive, but collapsible proofing boxes ($40-50) are basically an insulated cozy with a controllable heat pad in the bottom, and they fold up very flat when not in use. I finally treated myself to one after 15+ years of baking so that I could make bread when the house is cold, and it's a game changer. Dough simply does not rise in a cold house. I used to wing it by putting my dough under a tub and constantly re-steaming the tub with open containers of freshly boiled water, but this takes a lot of babysitting and is super annoying. Home bakers who live alone have funny tricks like proofing their dough in the laundry dryer, or in the oven with only the light on, but appliances are too high-usage in coops for me to do that.
