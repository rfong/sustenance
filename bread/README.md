# bread
+ [pain_lancienne.md](pain_lancienne.md) - Delayed fermentation bread, or pain l'ancienne. Instant yeast based. Extremely low-effort bread, no dough babysitting time. Very bready tasting, not sour. 15 min active work (5 min mixing, 2-3 days waiting, 10 min shaping on bake day). Requires dough fridge space for 2-3 days. Crowd pleaser.
+ [sourdough_ciabatta.md](sourdough_ciabatta.md) - I call my variant "Fool's Ciabatta". A super-high-hydration quick ferment using both sourdough starter and instant yeast. Extremely moist and holey with fantastic rise and a mild yet rich flavor. Soft but browned crust. Only a little more work than pain l'ancienne. 5 min active work, 1-3 hrs of occasional babysitting, then 10 min of baking work. Crowd pleaser. Can be done either same day or overnight.
+ [sourdough_tartine.md](sourdough_tartine.md) - Tartine-style sourdough. Not too sour, tender and holey crumb but not too holey, crunchy crust, very beautiful when done correctly. Tasty but effortful; requires a solid day of babysitting (about 8 hrs on/off) and then the next morning (~1.5 hrs).
+ [ny_sourdough_bagels.md](ny_sourdough_bagels.md) - Adaptation of Peter Reinhart's NY-style sourdough bagels to work with less fridge space.
+ [flatbread.md](flatbread.md) - Quick and simple flatbread mountain party pile for those who crave flatbread. Requires a powerful range hood and good ventilation. I have definitely set off the smoke alarm before. Best with 1-2 helpers.
+ [seedy_bread.md](seedy_bread.md) - Hearty moist seedy bread with some whole wheat and rye flour! Crowd pleaser. Similar amount of work to ciabatta, longer primary fermentation. Uses a dutch oven.

## use cases
- Want to quickly produce a very large volume of inexpensive and delicious calories for a potluck/picnic? Make high-hydration ciabatta, pain l'ancienne, or seedy bread.
- Want to punish yourself while simultaneously deepening your understanding of bread chemistry and perfecting your mastery over bread variables? Try Tartine-style sourdough.
- Want to do an interactive bread activity with friends? Try flatbread mountain (quick & super easy), soft pretzels (medium speed & ease), or sourdough bagels (prep required).
- "I don't have time to make bread": I made pain l'ancienne 2-3 times a week while working 90 hrs/week as an MIT undergrad with a $100-120/mo food budget, so I'm pretty confident that anyone with an oven and a fridge can fit this bread into their lifestyle. It really is that low-effort. And it's nice for a student budget that you can get bread flour from restaurant supply stores for $0.40/lb!

## my tools
*necessary*

+ bread knife
+ 500F-capable oven
+ baking sheets
+ large, wide vessel for mixing dough (I either use a wide metal mixing bowl or a clear 8-quart tub, both from the restaurant supply store)
+ bench scraper

*necessary if you want to Follow A Recipe, but lots of home bakers just wing it*
+ kitchen scale with tare function

*useful, but easy to improvise from random kitchen implements*

+ reusable bowl wrap (I have a Bee's Wrap, which isn't remotely airtight, so I tie it down with a piece of paracord)
+ parchment paper or 500F-resistant silicone sheet liner (can also use cornmeal/semolina, or grease although that has a higher chance of burning the bottom)
+ Dutch oven (or can use a combo cooker or any other upside-down oven-safe pot to trap steam, or you can just steam the oven)
+ shaped proofing vessel (can use floursack towels + mixing bowl, or banneton if you want that fancy look)
+ cooling rack (I did fine without one for the first decade of baking and finally got myself one as a little treat)
+ probe thermometer

I'm used to fudging water temperatures from brewing tea all the time, so I don't use a thermometer. For example, if I want 100-110F water for my yeast, I'll do about 40% boiling water + 60% fridge water, i.e. `(212*0.4) + (50*0.6) ~= 115`, and assume I've lost several degrees by transference into a room temperature container. You can also be less exact and dunk your hand straight into the water. If it feels hot but you can leave your hand in the water without active pain, then it's probably somewhere in the 90-110F range.
