# pain l'ancienne (delayed fermentation bread)

Lazily adapted from Peter Reinhardt's *The Bread Baker's Apprentice*.

**Optimizes for** active time, prep time, and ease. Highly bready but not sour.

This is the lowest-effort very-bready-tasting bread I've ever made. You only need to do 5 min of active work before the proofing step and before the baking step, so you can actually leave the house and do something else while the dough is rising, unlike with more needy rustic breads.

Gratification | Minimum delay
:--- | ---
Thinking about bread --> having bread in your mouth | 2-3 days
Taking dough out of fridge --> having bread in your mouth | 3-4 hours

### Scheduling

The dough is mixed ~3 days before you bake it. The shaping, rise, and baking happen on the same day. You don't need to babysit the dough at all, so this is a really easy bread for busy people. I found it easy to regularly make it multiple times a week at MIT and while employed full-time.

**Example schedule**
- Thursday (5-10 min): Mix dough and immediately refrigerate.
- Sunday (5 min): Shape dough and leave out at room temperature.
- (Break for 2-4 hours, flexible, dependent on room temperature)
- Bake. (~30 min babysitting)

### Explanation

tl;dr is that this method increases breakdown of complex carbohydrates while keeping yeast inactive longer, increasing eventual availability of sugars for the Maillard reaction (enzymatic browning).

I've written [a detailed visual presentation here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rHwvIju0Y6v59li60ozArehN2Ak4jTAfD6dlT3CjaIU/edit?usp=sharing) about the science of delayed-fermentation bread.

## Ingredients

+ 27 oz bread flour
+ 2-1/4 tsp (0.56 oz) salt
  + (I double if using very coarse salt due to packing suboptimality)
+ 1-3/4 tsp (0.19 oz) instant yeast
+ 2 cups cold water, plus more if needed

**Halved**
+ 13.5 oz bread flour
+ 1-1/8 tsp salt
+ 1 tsp instant yeast
+ 1 cup cold water, plus more if needed

**Note about temperature**: Reinhardt recommends ice cold (40F) water and getting the dough immediately into the fridge with minimal heat transfer. I found that when I aggressively prioritized this, bread flavor was wondrously maximized (95th percentile) at cost of suboptimal (20th percentile) crumb texture, possibly due to the lack of dough malleability. This may be mitigated if you use an electric mixer; I go by hand.

I usually just use cold tap water and it's fine.

## Methodology

This recipe is extremely simple and mindless to execute once you've done it a couple times. However, it's **important** to be familiar with all the reasoning so that you understand why some instructions are important and some are flexible, and so that you can debug when things don't go exactly as expected.

### Dough (5-10 min)
**1. Mix the dry ingredients thoroughly in a large bowl. Mix in the water quickly until fully incorporated.**

+ Desired dough consistency: still a bit sticky, but easily releases from the sides of the bowl and from your hands. At the perfect consistency, the dough will basically clean the bowl for you.
+ Spend no more time mixing the dough than necessary; your goal is for it to stay cold and not absorb too much heat from your hands or the room temperature.
+ I use a fork at first to avoid heat transfer, then switch to hands when the dough has become a large and unwieldy mass.
+ The dough will rise a bit more than double, so pick a bowl 2-3x deeper than your start ingredients take up.

**2. If the dough will not finish incorporating, dribble in small spoonfuls of water as needed.**

*Debugging*
+ If dough is *fully incorporated* but too sticky, add flour. Make a mental note to decrease your starting amount of water next time.
+ If dough refuses to fully incorporate, dribble in only a spoonful of water at a time and quickly re-incorporate until the consistency is correct.
+ It is much harder to recover from too much water than too much flour, so my recipe undershoots on water and starts on the dry end. You may end up needing anywhere between 2 and 2.5 cups depending on ambient parameters.

**3. Cover with plastic and transfer to fridge immediately.**

### Enzymatic breakdown (wait ~3 days)

**Refrigerate for 2-5 days. I like 3 days best.**
  + The flavor is just starting to become bready at 2 days.
  + After 5 days, it might over-ferment and start to have a weird consistency. Additionally, if your plastic wrap is not airtight, the dough tends to dry around the edges.
  
### Proof (2-4 hours)

**PROOF: Take dough out of fridge and let rise (still covered with plastic) at a warm room temperature until *doubled in size*, 2-4 hours.**

At a comfortable room temperature, I find dough takes around 2-4 hours to double. However, if it's particularly cold in your house, aka winter on the East Coast, this may take 6 hours. Keep it covered so it doesn't lose moisture.

If this is your first time, check once an hour to get a sense for how fast the dough rises in your kitchen. Otherwise, you don't need to touch or babysit the dough; you can leave the house and come back when you're ready to bake.

Timing here is relatively flexible. Just don't accidentally leave it out for like, 8 hours, or it can dry out or become excessively gassy and lose its shape (since we aren't doing much in the way of gluten formation).

### Shape & bake (30 min)

**1. PREHEAT: Set oven to 500F. Add a steam pan containing 1+ cups water on bottom rack.**

Steam serves several important purposes:
  + delays crust formation, allowing for greater dough expansion
  + gelatinizes more starch at the surface
  + increases surface heat transfer and therefore exterior crispiness without negatively impacting the soft interior
  
A "steam pan" is just any oven-safe open vessel that can hold a cup or two of water.

**2. SHAPE: Flour the dough, cut into 4-6 pieces, transfer to pans, and score the tops.**

Liberally sprinkle a clean surface (counter, board, etc) with flour. Gently transfer dough to the floured surface, trying not to de-gas it. Dip your dry hands in flour. Gently stretch the dough into a rectangle while flouring its surface.

Cut into 4-6 strips *depending on your crumb/crust ratio preference*.
  + I prefer 4 pieces, which yield loaves about the size of a forearm, which is a nice ratio of crispy crust to soft crumb for dipping and buttering.
  + Reinhardt recommends 6 pieces, which yields thin baguettes that are mostly crust.

Prep two sheet pans with baking parchment or spray oil. Transfer the dough to them and gently elongate the strips to the length of the pan, still trying not to degas.

Diagonally score the tops several times with a sharp knife. I score very deeply; about halfway into the depth of the dough. This allows the bread to expand instead of becoming domed, maximizing the crusty surface and allowing some steam to escape. Also it looks cool.

**3. BAKE: Put the bread in the oven. Lower the temperature to 475F. After 8 minutes, rotate the pans. Continue baking until the tops are a rich golden brown, about 10-15 minutes.**

Bread should be finished by sight -- take it out when it looks golden brown and delicious.

**4. COOL: 10+ minutes.**

Even if you are willing to eat scalding hot bread, be patient, as cooling is an important continuation of the cooking process. The inside of the loaf is still cooking. If you attempt to eat it now, the crumb will be underbaked.

### Serve!

I like to mix a plate of olive oil, salt, pepper, and a dash of balsamic vinegar.

Will feed 4-5 ravenous bread-fiends, or 10+ casual bread nibblers.
