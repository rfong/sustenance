# Tartine sourdough - extended autolyse variant

My current variant quickref for making [sourdough_tartine.md](sourdough_tartine.md). If you have not made this kind of sourdough before, practice with the more detailed writeup a few times first, to get everything into your muscle memory and calibrate to your kitchen environment as needed.

### Flour
Use bread flour, defaulting to unbleached. You can substitute some percentage of whole wheat, but it will require more hydration.

May 2025: I recently got into unsifted fresh-milled whole wheat flour (which either needs to be used up within ~2 weeks or stored in the fridge/freezer). My favorite blend so far is 20% Khorasan and 80% hard red wheat. The usual 78% hydration approach worked well, but it would have been better with more hydration. Will report back on procedural changes.

### Notes on extended autolyse variant
To couple a more intense savory bready flavor with the sourdough flavor, I like to do a hybrid variant between pain a l'ancienne and Tartine sourdough by adding an extended autolyse. 

The only thing that changes is that I mix the post-levain flour with the post-levain water (reserving ~50g water to help with mixing later) 3-12 hours before the standard autolyse step. For laziness reasons, I either line it up so that I'm either starting the extended autolyse when I mix the levain, or during the final starter feeding that runs overnight.

### Cutting corners
- I stopped using the flour-rubbed cloth liners for proofing.
- I stopped flouring the dough during shaping.
- I just do one large loaf instead of dividing the dough in two and re-shaping. So I skip the middle cycle.
- I may or may not add the salt at the start of the fermentolyse.

## Instructions

### STARTER
Feed in AM/PM, at least three times if waking it up from fridge dormancy.

### Pick a hydration level

Hydration | Post-levain water (for 700g flour)
:--- | ---
74% | 500g (divided 450 + 50)
78% | 530g (divided 480 + 50)
82% | 560g (divided 510 + 50)

### START EXTENDED AUTOLYSE

Combine the bulk of the flour with post-levain water (lukewarm), holding back 50g for later.

### LEVAIN (3+ hrs)
+ *1 heaping Tbsp sourdough starter*
+ *75 grams bread flour*
+ *75 grams warm water*

Cover and float test once an hour, starting at 3 hours, until ready.

### DOUGH (minimum 4.5 hrs)

#### FERMENTOLYSE (15m active + 0.5-4 hrs wait time)

Incorporate levain with bulk of dough. The salt and extra water may also be added during this step, or later (for more yeast activity) if you have time to spare.

Dissolve a tablespoon of coarse salt in the 50g of water (lukewarm) you held back earlier. Then fully incorporate into the dough.

Cover and let rest 30 minutes to 4 hours.

#### BULK RISE (3-4 hrs)
Plan so that you will have a 4-hour continuous block to be around the house for this.

Fold or coil dough from every direction. 5-6 times, once every half hour. Use wet hands to gently adjust hydration level if dough seems too dry. By the end, should be a smooth round mass with good surface tension. Dough should always stay covered when not being worked.

Let rest for 30 minutes.

#### ~~MIDDLE CYCLE (40 min) (only if dividing the dough)~~

Flour a work surface. Divide the dough in half.

Lightly flour each piece and shape into rounds with your pastry scraper.

Let rest for 30 minutes. Prepare proofing containers.

#### FINAL SHAPING (10 min)

~~Dust dough with flour.~~ Flip and increase surface tension by gently pulling all four sides over into the middle with your pastry scraper.

~~Dust with flour all over.~~ Place into proofing vessels with the seam side up, and cover.

### PROOF

If proofing in fridge, ideally 16-18 hours. Minimum 12, maximum 20.

If proofing at room temperature, probably 3-4 hours but may vary.

### BAKE (1.5-2 hrs)

Place Dutch oven(s) in the oven and preheat to 500F.

When preheat is finished, take out the Dutch oven and line the bottom to prevent sticking (can use parchment paper, semolina, cornmeal, etc). Take dough out of fridge and score deeply at an angle. Drop dough into Dutch oven.

Reduce temperature to 475F. **Bake covered for 20 minutes.** ~~Meanwhile, soak the flour-covered towel in hot water and/or scrub with a bristle brush to get the flour off.~~

Remove the lid and bake uncovered until it looks done, about another 20 minutes depending on loaf size.

Transfer to wire rack and let cool for 10+ minutes.

### SERVE

I'm a fan of salted butter and goat cheese.
