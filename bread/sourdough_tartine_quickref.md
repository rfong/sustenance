# Tartine sourdough quickref & variants

Quick reference for making [sourdough_tartine.md](sourdough_tartine.md) if you have already done this enough times to get it into your muscle memory, calibrated the measurements to your kitchen environment, and no longer need the detailed explanations.

## FLOUR
Use bread flour, defaulting to unbleached. You can substitute some percentage of whole wheat, but it will require more hydration.

May 2025: I recently got into unsifted fresh-milled whole wheat flour (which either needs to be used up within ~2 weeks or stored in the fridge/freezer). My favorite blend so far is 20% Khorasan and 80% hard red wheat. The usual 78% hydration approach worked well, but it would have been better with more hydration. Will report back on procedural changes.

## HYBRID VARIANT
To couple a more intense savory bready flavor with the sourdough flavor, I like to do a hybrid variant between pain a l'ancienne and Tartine sourdough by adding an extended autolyse. 

The only thing that changes is that I mix the post-levain flour with the post-levain water (reserving ~50g water to help with mixing later) up to half a day before the standard autolyse step. I usually line it up so that I'm starting the extended autolyse either when I mix the levain, or during the final starter feeding that runs overnight.

## CUTTING CORNERS
- I stopped using the flour-rubbed cloth liners for proofing.
- I stopped flouring the dough during shaping.
- I usually just do one large loaf instead of dividing the dough in two and re-shaping.

## INSTRUCTIONS

### STARTER
Feed in AM/PM, at least three times before you start the dough.

### LEVAIN (3+ hrs)
+ *1 heaping Tbsp sourdough starter*
+ *75 grams bread flour*
+ *75 grams water*

Cover and float test once an hour, starting at 3 hours, until ready.

### DOUGH (minimum 4.5 hrs)

Pick a hydration level.

Hydration | Post-levain water
:--- | ---
74% | 500g (divided 450 + 50)
78% | 530g (divided 480 + 50)
82% | 560g (divided 510 + 50)

#### AUTOLYSE (15m active + 0.5-4 hrs wait time)
+ *450-510 grams water*
+ *700 grams bread flour*

Stir water into levain, then flour, until fully incorporated. Cover and let rest for 30 min to 4 hours.

Plan so that you will have a 4-hour continuous block in which to tend to the bulk rise, middle cycle, and shaping.

#### BULK RISE (3 hrs)
+ *1 tablespoon sea salt*
+ *50 grams water*

Fully dissolve the salt in the water. Fully incorporate into dough. Should be shaggy and sticky. May stick to the bowl.

Fold dough from every direction. 6 times, once every half hour. Use wet hands to gently adjust hydration level if dough seems too dry. By the end, should be a smooth round mass, but still floppy.

Let rest for 30 minutes.

#### MIDDLE CYCLE (40 min)

Flour a work surface. Divide the dough in half.

Lightly flour each piece and shape into rounds with your pastry scraper.

Let rest for 30 minutes. Prepare proofing containers.

#### FINAL SHAPING (10 min)

Dust dough with flour. Flip and increase surface tension by gently pulling all four sides over into the middle with your pastry scraper.

Dust with flour all over and place into lined proofing bowls/baskets so the seam side is up.

### PROOF

Cover and rise in fridge for 12+ hours, or at room temp for 3-4 hours.

### BAKE (1.5-2 hrs)

Place Dutch oven(s) in the oven and preheat to 500F.

When preheat is finished, take out the Dutch oven. Take dough out of fridge and score deeply at an angle with a serrated bread knife. Drop dough into Dutch oven.

Reduce temperature to 475F. **Bake covered for 20 minutes.** Meanwhile, soak the flour-covered towel in hot water and/or scrub with a bristle brush to get the flour off.

Remove the lid and **bake uncovered for another 20 minutes** (or until a deep brown by sight).

Transfer to wire rack and let cool for 10+ minutes.

### SERVE

I'm a fan of salted butter and goat cheese.
