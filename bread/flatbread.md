are nearly identical. "Skillet flatbread" is a little faster to make, so let's go with that.

# Ingredients

I usually make 36 flatbreads at a time. They will get eaten faster than you think, but they are also very filling.

| **Ingredient** | **12 flatbreads** | **36 flatbread mountain** |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| flour | 360 g (3 cups) | 1080g (9 cups) |
| baking powder | 2 tsp | 2 Tbsp |
| salt | 1-1/2 tsp | 1-1/2 Tbsp |
| oil | 3 Tbsp | 9 Tbsp (1/2 cup + 1 Tbsp) |
| ice water | 1 cup (227 g) | 3 cups (681 g) |
| additional oil for frying | | |

# Instructions

Mix the dry ingredients in one bowl. Then add the wet ingredients and mix/knead until the dough is cohesive and smooth. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes.

## Shaping

Divide the dough evenly into the number of pieces you want.

Prepare a floured work surface and/or an optional plate of flour to dredge the dough in.

Roll each piece into a ball, dredge lightly in flour, and shape into 4-6" rounds. 
(It's fine if they aren't round; mine usually come out shaped like Australia.) 
You can flatten them with your hands, but it's faster to use a French or Chinese rolling pin.

## Frying

Prepare a place to put your finished flatbreads that is capable of catching a lot of oil. 
You can use a large quantity of paper towels. I tend to use a cooling rack over a baking sheet.

Preheat a cast iron skillet with a tablespoon of oil. Fry flatbreads for 2-3 minutes on each side or until golden brown, and replenish oil as needed.

### Splitting up the work
This tends to work best if you have at least two people.

When making 36 flatbreads, I find it easiest with three people: one grillmaster managing two frying pans, and two people shaping the flatbreads.

### Ventilation

It's gonna get smoky really fast, so turn on the hood and any fans/filters you have and open the windows for good measure before you start frying.
