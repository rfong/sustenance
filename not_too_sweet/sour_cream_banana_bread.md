sour cream banana bread
-----

### Manifesto

Optimizes for: light, spongy, fluffy, non-greasy, not too sweet. This does not taste at all like a dessert/cake; it's more like if you waved a magic wand and made a banana into a bread texture and less sweet. This is a life staple I made up in college to use up old bananas. Great for roadtrips, camping, and breakfast.

Delayed gratification caveat: requires an overnight in the fridge to set the consistency and moistness. Tastes really dry and bad if you try to eat it straight out of the oven, but it will be perfect the next day.

### Ingredients

Wet:
+ 2 eggs, beaten
+ 1/4 cup sugar, brown or turbinado
+ 1 tsp vanilla extract
+ a dash of cardamom; also feel free to add cinnamon or similar chai spices
+ 1/4-1/3 cup neutral-tasting oil
+ 1 cup sour cream

Dry:
+ 1-1/2 cups flour
+ 1 tsp baking soda
+ 1/2 tsp salt

Add after wet+dry combined:
+ 3-4 ripe bananas

### Methodology

+ Beat the eggs first or they will combine badly.
+ Mix the wet and dry ingredients in separate bowls, then combine thoroughly.
+ Smash the bananas in AFTER everything else has been mixed.
+ Grease a 9x5 loaf pan and bake at 350F for ~70 minutes (or until a toothpick comes out clean). If you use more sugar than me, you will need to bake for less time. 
+ Let cool, then put it in the fridge and do not think about it for at least 12 hours. Extra yummy if you warm it up a bit when serving.

### Notes

+ Baking in one 9x5 loaf pan will yield a moist loaf with a square-ish cross-section.
+ If you're a sucker for that caramelized-brown crust, you can split it into two 9x5 loaf pans or one 9x9 pan and bake for less time.
