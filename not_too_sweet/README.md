# not-too-sweet

### heuristics

+ I don't merely lack a sweet tooth; I actually have an intolerance to processed sugar and artificial sweeteners. (Most unprocessed fruit is fine.) I get extremely nauseous if I eat more than a nibble of a typical American cookie. Everyone thinks this is sad, but for me it is just something I have never missed, because I do not actually enjoy the taste of sugar on account of associating it with needing to throw up.
+ My preference ranges about 25-60% less sugar than standard English-language recipes I find.
+ I like being punched in the tongue with flavors!! This usually manifests as double to triple the spice of standard recipes.
