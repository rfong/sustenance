# not-too-sweet

### heuristics

+ I don't merely lack a sweet tooth; I actually have an intolerance to processed sugar and artificial sweeteners. I get extremely nauseous if I eat more than a nibble of a typical American cookie. Everyone thinks this is sad, but for me it is just something I have never missed, because I do not actually enjoy the taste of processed sugar on account of associating it with vomit.
+ My preference ranges about 25-60% less sugar than standard English-language recipes I fid.
+ I like being punched in the tongue with flavors. This usually manifests as double to triple the spice of standard recipes.

Adjust in the reverse direction accordingly if you do not share these parameters.
