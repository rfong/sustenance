# not-too-sweet

### heuristics

+ I don't merely lack a sweet tooth; I actually get nauseous to the point of throwing up from American-dessert levels of sweetness, which can only be achieved with lots of processed sugar or artificial sweeteners. Most traditional Chinese sweets are fine for me in small quantities because 不會太甜. Unprocessed fruit is also fine.
+ My preference ranges about 25-60% less sugar than standard English-language recipes I find.
+ I like being punched in the tongue with flavors!! This usually manifests as double to triple the spice of standard recipes.
