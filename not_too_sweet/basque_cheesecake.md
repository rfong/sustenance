oh no I lost the recipe and need to re-derive it

to try: [4-ingredient recipe with keto substitution suggestions](https://kirbiecravings.com/4-ingredient-basque-cheesecake/)
- 16 oz cream cheese (room temp)
- granulated sugar: recipe suggests 1 cup, I will do 1/3-1/2
- 3 large eggs
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 500F in a 7" round pan, bake 25 min, cool & refrigerate overnight
- if using sugar substitute, lower to 450F halfway through and bake til center has set

Trial runs
- Tried making it with stevia and it came out tasting like a slightly sweetened omelette. Terrible. Going to try again with regular sugar
