IN PROGRESS; trying to find a way to make it less sweet

most recipes suggest broiling the top; I don't do this any more since it usually catches on fire for me

### Adapted from [Okonomi kitchen](https://www.okonomikitchen.com/basque-cheesecake/)
- 16 oz cream cheese, room temp
- 1/4-1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- optionally 1/4 cup sour cream

500F in a 9x5 loaf pan lined with parchment paper, 25min. It will come out of the oven poofy and then collapse after cooling, which is to be expected.

The recommended Aesthetic(TM) form factor is a round cake pan, but I don't have any of those, so if you do you'll have to re-derive the right duration to bake for.

### Notes
- Trial 1, jan 2026: 1/4 cup sugar, 9x5 loaf pan. A bit too sugary for my stomach; I wonder if honey would give me less nausea? Could use more vanilla. Texture was good but just starting to border on eggy, could be creamier and softer. Try the sour cream next time.
- I have not found a reasonable way to make this keto yet. Tried a stevia keto variant from [KirbieCravings]([url](https://kirbiecravings.com/4-ingredient-basque-cheesecake/)) that came out tasting like a bad omelette which I had to throw out.
