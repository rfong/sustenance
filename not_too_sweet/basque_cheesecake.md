oh no I lost the recipe and need to re-derive it

the original recipe I remember using suggested a broiler (which I stopped doing because it caught fire) and had at least a cup of heavy cream

### [Okonomi kitchen](https://www.okonomikitchen.com/basque-cheesecake/)
- 16 oz cream cheese, room temp
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- optionally 1/4 cup sour cream

450F in a 6" round pan lined with parchment paper, 26-35 min.
if top is not dark enough, broil 2-3 min

### [4-ingredient recipe with keto substitution suggestions](https://kirbiecravings.com/4-ingredient-basque-cheesecake/)
- 16 oz cream cheese, room temp
- granulated sugar: recipe suggests 1 cup, I will do 1/3-1/2
- 3 large eggs
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 500F in a 7" round pan, bake 25 min, cool & refrigerate overnight
- if using sugar substitute, lower to 450F halfway through and bake til center has set

Trial runs
- Tried making it with stevia and it came out tasting like a slightly sweetened omelette. Terrible. Threw it out.
