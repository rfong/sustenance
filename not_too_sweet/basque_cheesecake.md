oh no I lost the recipe and need to re-derive it

the original recipe I remember using suggested a broiler (which I stopped doing because it caught fire) and had at least a cup of heavy cream

### [Okonomi kitchen](https://www.okonomikitchen.com/basque-cheesecake/)
- 16 oz cream cheese, room temp
- 1/4-1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- optionally 1/4 cup sour cream

500F in a 9x5 loaf pan lined with parchment paper, 25min. If top is not dark enough, broil 2-3 more min. It will come out of the oven poofy and then collapse after cooling, which is to be expected.

The recommended Aesthetic(TM) form factor is a round cake pan, but I don't have any of those, so if you do you'll have to re-derive the right duration to bake for.

### Notes
- Trial 1, jan 2026: 1/4 cup sugar, 9x5 loaf pan. Slightly too sugary for me; I wonder if honey would work better? Could use more vanilla. Texture was good but just starting to border on eggy, could be creamier and softer. Try the sour cream next time.
- I have not found a reasonable way to make this keto yet. Tried a stevia keto variant from [KirbieCravings]([url](https://kirbiecravings.com/4-ingredient-basque-cheesecake/)) that came out tasting like a bad omelette which I had to throw out.
