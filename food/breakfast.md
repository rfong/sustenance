# loose aussie bites (not too sweet)

slightly modified from [thestayathomechef's recipe](https://thestayathomechef.com/homemade-aussie-bites/)

I don't have a mini muffin pan, so I just spread these out on a normal sheet pan like granola and deal with it being loose.

### dry ingredients
- 1-1/2 cups rolled oats
- 2 cups oat flour (can make by pulverizing 2 cups rolled oats in food processor)
- 1/2 cup ground flaxseed
- 1/4 cup chia seeds
- 1/2 cup other seeds/nuts
- 1/2 cup uncooked quinoa
- 1 cup chopped dried fruit
- 1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
- 1/2 tsp baking soda

### wet ingredients
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter (can be vegan), melted
- 1/4 cup honey, or substitute agave syrup to make it vegan
- 1/2 cup oil (I prefer coconut)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

### methodology
- preheat oven to 350F
- combine the dries, combine the wets, mix all together
- line a sheet pan with parchment paper or silpat, spread out the mixture evenly on it
- bake for about 20 minutes or until top is lightly browned
