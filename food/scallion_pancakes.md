# Scallion pancakes

TODO: incorporate notes from *The Vegan Chinese Kitchen*.

### Heuristics

[The Food Lab](https://www.seriouseats.com/2011/04/the-food-lab-how-to-make-scallion-pancakes-chinese-appetizers.html): Doughs made with cold water (most western breads/pastries) have more gluten formation and elasticity. Hot water doughs (often found in Chinese food) have denatured proteins. This prevents structure formation and leads to tender dough with little elasticity.

Adapted from [The Food Lab](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/04/extra-flaky-scallion-pancakes-recipe.html) and [Omnivore's Cookbook](https://omnivorescookbook.com/chinese-scallion-pancakes/). Makes 6 pancakes.

## Ingredients

### Dough
- 2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting work surface
- 1 cup boiling water
- 1/4 cup cold water
- 4 thinly sliced scallions (added at the end)

### Paste for dough
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup sesame oil
- 1 tsp coarse salt
- (optional) 1/2 to 1 tsp ground Sichuan peppercorns

### Dipping sauce
- 2 Tbsp soy sauce
- 2 Tbsp Chinkiang or rice vinegar
- pinch of red pepper flakes
- drizzle of sesame oil
- 1 tsp grated or minced fresh ginger
- 2 tsp brown sugar

## Instructions

#### Dough

Drizzle the hot water into the flour while stirring. If not fully incorporated, drizzle in the cold water a spoonful at the time. Dough should end up a bit sticky, as we will be adding more flour later.

Transfer to a floured surface and knead into a smooth ball.

Cover and rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

#### Pancake formation

Mix the paste.

Lightly flour a work surface. Divide dough in six pieces.

Roll out ball into a 12-18" long strip. Spread a thin layer of paste over it. Roll up the strip on the long axis into a rope and then coil it up into a spiral.

Repeat the process once, but this time also add a loose handful of scallions before rolling it up. Flatten out into a disk about the thickness of a chopstick.

#### Cook

Make the sauce.

Heat 1 Tbsp vegetable oil in a pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Fry each pancake side until golden brown, being careful not to splash the hot oil.

Transfer to paper towel lined plate. Cut into wedges and serve.

# Hard version (adapted from The Vegan Chinese Kitchen)

extra flaky and scrumptious but extra laborious

scaled up 2x to make 12 pancakes

## Dough (start the day before)
- 1150g flour, ideally a mix of all-purpose and pastry flour
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 2 cups boiling water
- 1-1/4 cup cool water

Combine flour & salt in a heat-resistant bowl. Incorporate the boiling water. Then incorporate the cool water. Knead about 2 minutes until the dough comes together smoothly. Refrigerate overnight.

## Scallion paste
- 180g all-purpose flour
- 1 Tbsp kosher salt
- 2 cups thinly sliced scallion greens (about 12 scallions)
- 2 tsp ground Sichuan peppercorns
- 1 cup veg oil

Combine flour and salt in a heat-resistant bowl, top with the scallions/spices. Heat oil on high until nearly smoking, then pour into the bowl. Stir into a paste.

## Pancake formation

Divide the dough into 12 portions.

Flour a surface. Roll into as thin a rectangle as you can get. Dust with flour as needed to prevent sticking. Spread with a thin layer of the scallion paste. Roll it up into a log.

Stretch out the log and then roll that up into a spiral. Shape it into a 1" thick disk. After all the disks are formed, gently roll them out to 1/4" thick.

At this point you can freeze them for later.

## Cooking

Heat a thin layer of oil until the oil shimmers. Cover the pancake and cook for 3 minutes. Flip and cook uncovered until crisp on both sides.
