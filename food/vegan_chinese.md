## lotus sticky rice

adapted (mostly copied) from _The Five Elements Cookbook_ by Zoey Xinyi Gong

makes around 4 servings if supplementing with a veggie dish, or 2 meals if you are a rice maniac like me and want to eat just this dish

### the night before
soak one whole lotus leaf, or alternatively enough bamboo leaves to line one 10" steamer on top and bottom

rinse grains til water is clear, then soak: 
- 1/3 cup lotus seeds
- 1 cup glutinous millet
- 1 cup white sticky rice
- 1/2 cup purple sticky rice
- 2 Tbsp adzuki beans
- 1/3 cup coix seeds (if you can find them)
- 2 Tbsp fox nuts (if you can find them)

marinate 1/2 lb protein of choice in:
- 2 Tbsp soy sauce
- 2 Tbsp sesame oil
- 1 Tbsp minced ginger
- 2 Tbsp minced scallions
- 1 Tbsp rice cooking wine

the day of:
- 1/2-1 cup fresh shiitake mushrooms, chopped finely. if using dried ones, presoak in hot water for 10+ minutes
- preheat 3+ liters of water and pour it into a big pot. set your 10" bamboo steamer on top. DO NOT USE A WOK because it will not hold enough water for the entire steam ASK ME HOW I FOUND OUT
- line the steamer with your leaf/leaves
- drain the grains, add the mushrooms, layer in the protein and drizzle the marinade on top, cover up everything with the leaf/leaves
- steam 40-50 minutes or until soft, CHECK MIDWAY AND MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT RUNNING OUT OF WATER
