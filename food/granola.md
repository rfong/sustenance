# chunky granola, not too sweet

why is store granola so vomitously sweet and so expensive?? make your own for $3/lb thanks!

adapted from [vegan maple almond granola clusters](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/maple-almond-granola-clusters-vegan/). 
changes: halved the sugar, swapped out syrup/sugar for honey, added flax seeds and cashews, tried different flours

this fills about 2 quart jars, which is roughly a week's supply of granola for me (I'm usually supplementing it with nut butter, fruit, and/or yogurt for breakfast)

notes on cluster formation: almond flour is the only flour I have tried so far that helps with cluster formation. if you sub wheat flour or oat flour, this recipe will come out dry and powdery and will NOT form clusters. let me know if you find other flours that work.

## ingredients
Base ingredients:
- 3 cups rolled oats
- 3/4 cup almond flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/3 cup coconut oil
- 1/4-1/3 cup honey/sugar/syrup
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

For fun:
- 3/4 cup chopped unsalted nuts/seeds
- 1/4 cup flaxmeal

Cost: $5-6.65/batch depending what nuts/seeds you use

## methodology
- mix the dry stuff in one bowl, whisk sugar/oil/vanilla in a small saucepan over medium heat, combine everything
- press into an even layer on parchment-paper-lined pan
- bake at 300F, 40 minutes, rotate midway

## variant: IRON GRANOLA
- 3 cups rolled oats (4.4 mg iron per 100g)
- 3/4 cup almond flour (3.7 mg iron per 100g)
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 cup black sesame seeds (14.6 mg iron per 100g)
- 1 cup raw cashews, roughly chopped (6 mg iron per 100g)
- 1/4 cup flaxmeal (5.7 mg iron per 100g)

wets:
- 1/2 cup coconut oil
- 1/2 cup honey/sugar/syrup
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

This yields 2.5 quarts of granola, at 53 mg iron per batch. Each batch lasts me 7 days because I am a big eater, which comes out to 7.8 mg per serving. YMMV if you have a normal appetite.

Cost: ~$9.30/batch. More expensive but still a lot cheaper than store granola, or the cost of anemia.
