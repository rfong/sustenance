# chunky granola, not too sweet

why is store granola so vomitously sweet and so expensive?? make your own for $3/lb thanks

adapted from [vegan maple almond granola clusters](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/maple-almond-granola-clusters-vegan/). 
changes: halved the sugar, swapped out syrup/sugar for honey, added flax seeds and cashews, tried different flours

this fills about 2 quart jars, which is roughly a week's supply of granola for me (I'm usually supplementing it with nut butter, fruit, and/or yogurt for breakfast)

## ingredients
- 3 cups rolled oats
- 3/4 cup some kind of flour (so far I've tried almond and oat flour)
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 3/4 c chopped unsalted nuts (I use cashews)
- 1/4 cup flax seeds (I prefer the texture of whole flax for some reason, but you can use flaxmeal for better digestibility)
- 1/3 c coconut oil
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup honey (or whatever sticky thing you prefer)

The flour, coconut oil, and sugar are necessary for structural integrity. You can substitute them for other things that will bind at room temperature. The nuts and flax seeds are just for fun, you can substitute whatever you want.

## methodology
- mix the dry stuff in one bowl, whisk sugar/oil/vanilla in a small saucepan over medium heat, combine everything
- press into an even layer on parchment-paper-lined pan
- bake at 300F, 40 minutes, rotate midway
