# chunky granola, not too sweet

why is store granola so vomitously sweet and so expensive?? make your own for $3/lb thanks

adapted from [vegan maple almond granola clusters](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/maple-almond-granola-clusters-vegan/). 
changes: halved the sugar, swapped out syrup/sugar for honey, added flax seeds and cashews, tried different flours

this fills about 2 quart jars, which is roughly a week's supply of granola for me (I'm usually supplementing it with nut butter, fruit, and/or yogurt for breakfast)

## ingredients
Base ingredients:
- 3 cups rolled oats
- 3/4 cup almond flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/3 cup coconut oil
- 1/4-1/3 cup honey (or whatever sticky thing you prefer)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

For fun:
- 3/4 cup chopped unsalted nuts (I use cashews)
- 1/4 cup flaxmeal

Flour: Almond flour has been the best so far. I tried substituting wheat flour and it came out too dry and powdery. Oat flour was okay.

## methodology
- mix the dry stuff in one bowl, whisk sugar/oil/vanilla in a small saucepan over medium heat, combine everything
- press into an even layer on parchment-paper-lined pan
- bake at 300F, 40 minutes, rotate midway

## variant: IRON GRANOLA
- Use the same base ingredients as the original recipe
- 1 cup black sesame seeds (14.6 mg iron per 100g)
- 2/3 cups raw pumpkin seeds (8.8 mg iron per 100g)
- 1 cup raw cashews (6 mg iron per 100g)
- 1/4 cup flaxmeal (5.7 mg iron per 100g)

This yields 38.6 mg iron per granola batch, or 5.5-6.4 mg per serving.

- Trial 1: Tastes good. Still figuring out how much binder is needed to form clusters. Used about 1/2 cup coconut oil and 1/3 cup honey this time. Try going up to 3/4 cup coconut oil and 1/2 cup honey next time.
