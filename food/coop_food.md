when I say "an amount of rice", that means:
- if you don't want leftover rice, use 1/3 to 1/2 dry cup per person depending on your audience's rice interest
- if you want to make fried rice tomorrow, fill the rice cooker to the max

## lentil soup

start an amount of rice in the rice cooker (I usually throw in a glob of coconut oil)

for broth, I usually use Better Than Bouillon's "No Chicken" base. I always undersalt a bit while cooking and then salt to taste after it's done cooking.

dark purple stew:
- saute minced garlic, diced shallot, & diced white/yellow onion in instant pot
- cumin and coriander
- dump in 3+ cups lentils, and broth at a 3:1 ratio
- add diced purple carrots, 1-2 diced japanese sweet potatoes, 1-2 bunches kale

classic western soup base:
- saute minced garlic & diced onion in large pot
- add diced celery & carrots
- cumin and coriander
- dump in 3+ cups lentils, and broth at a 3:1 ratio
- optional: add lemon juice & zest
- simmer ~30 min

lentil curry:
- saute on low heat in a generous amount of coconut oil: minced garlic, diced onions, julienned ginger, curry powder, turmeric, black pepper
- add 3+ cups lentils, and broth at a 3:1 ratio. for extra luxury you can sub in coconut cream for some of the liquids.
- simmer ~30 min, salt to taste
- top with chopped cilantro and/or tangy yogurt

## taco bar (choose your own adventure)

start an amount of rice in the rice cooker, maybe add cilantro/lime

- bean base: saute onions, add black beans, dash of liquid smoke, [vegan bacon salt](../spices/vegan_bacon_salt.md) maybe
- gently heat a stack of tortillas til steamy but still soft (~1 minute each) in a pan and store covered to retain heat
- topping options: chopped cilantro, sour cream, diced red onions, shredded cheese, guacamole, lime wedges, hot sauce

## stirfry

this doesn't scale well past 8 people unless you have two woks and/or a sous chef to help chop

start an amount of rice in the rice cooker, add a glob of coconut oil

protein base: high-protein (pre-pressed) tofu, cut into little sticks or triangles
- if I'm feeling lazy: stirfry quickly in vegan oyster sauce
- if I'm feeling spicy: tofu sticks with julienned ginger and thai chili paste
- if I'm feeling crunchy: toasty tofu triangles with Taiwanese "pepper salt for fried chicken" seasoning (works best in cast iron with potato starch for extra crisp)

veggie options
- chinese greens: saute julienned ginger in a splash of neutral oil and a drizzle of sesame oil. stirfry chopped dark leafy greens. my favorites are chrysanthemum greens, on choy, or yin choy. other solid options include bok choy, gai lan, spinach
- simple 1-2-3 eggplant: stirfry chinese eggplant chonks until bright purple, add 1-2-3 ratio of chinkiang vinegar, shaoxing cooking wine, and normal-strength soy sauce, simmer until fork tender, drizzle with a tiny bit of honey
- purple cabbage: chop thinly and lightly stir-fry with fennel seeds. check if someone in the audience dislikes fennel seeds first

serve with side/garnish of premade east asian pickles (I usually default to 福神漬, 柴漬け, pickled mustard greens, pickled ginger, or kimchi)

### a slightly more laborious eggplant dish

this is simplified from [Omnivore's Cookbook](https://omnivorescookbook.com/chinese-eggplant-with-garlic-sauce), which in turn looks like a simplified version of [Hannah Che's fish-fragrant eggplant recipe](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/hannah-che-fish-fragrant-eggplant-6890589). I have made Hannah Che's version once and it is unbelievably good, but very laborious.

- pre-soak chinese eggplant chonks in salted water for 15+ min. pat dry. pan fry til golden and set aside
- make a sauce from dark soy sauce watered down to normal soy sauce level, a spoonful of honey or sugar, and a spoonful of cornstarch
- stirfry garlic, ginger, scallions
- throw in the eggplant and sauce and stir til glossy and thickened a bit

### thai curry variant

- use a can of coconut cream and a few stalks of smashed lemongrass in the rice cooker. remove the lemongrass before serving
- simmer the protein and veggies together in thai curry paste, more lemongrass, and more coconut cream with broth
